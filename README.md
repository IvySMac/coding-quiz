# Coding Quiz

## Description 
To have a little bit of fun, my class and I are to create a quiz to test the skills that we have learned through the course. 

## Usage

![a tan box sits in the middle of the site with text inside that reads 'Coding Quiz Challenge'. Underneath it is a tagline that reads 'Try to answer the following code-related questions within the time limit. Keep in mind that incorrect answers will penalize your score/time by ten seconds!'. Below the tagline is a pink button that says start](quiz-screenshot.jpg)

Use this short little quiz to help test your knowledge on coding!
